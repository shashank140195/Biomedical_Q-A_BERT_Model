Recently, finerenone (BAY 94-8862) has emerged as a next-generation non-steroidal dihydropyridine-based MR antagonist designed to minimize off-target effects while maintaining potent efficacy. In this review, the outcomes of finerenone therapy in several diseases associated with MR activity are explored. The (pre-) clinical efficacy of finerenone is compared with that of traditional steroid-based MR antagonists. Finally, recent and ongoing clinical trials using finerenone to treat chronic HF, CKD, and diabetic nephropathy are discussed.

Substances affecting the function of the adrenergic system are the agonists or stimulators, which mimic the effects of endogenous norepinephrine or epinephrine, and antagonists or blockers, which block the receptors and prevent stimulation by the agonists. Autonomic stimulation in the eye mediates various changes which apparently affect outflow facility and rate of formation of aqueous humor. Alteration of either or both of these factors by autonomic agonists or antagonists may have a direct or an indirect effect on intraocular pressure. Beta-adrenergic blocking substances have been used to treat a variety of diseases. Some of the effects of these drugs are attributable to properties other than beta blockade, such as intrinsic sympathomimetic activity and local anaesthetic activity. Side effects of this class of drugs require caution in cases of congestive heart failure and in asthmatics. Autonomic agents used in the treatment of ocular hypertension and glaucoma include pilocarpine, a chilinergic agonist, epinephrine, an adrenergic agonist, and various beta adrenergic blockers or antagonists including propranolol, atenolol and timolol. The physico-chemical properties and pharmacokinetics of timolol are reviewed. Data showing a significant reduction in intraocular pressure as a result of ocular instillation of timolol are presented.

We generated T cell-specific SOCS1-deficient mice and found that these mice were extremely resistant to a Th17-dependent autoimmune disease model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. SOCS1-deficient naive CD4(+) T cells were predominantly differentiated into Th1 and poorly into Th17 in vitro. These phenotypes were canceled in IFN-gamma(-/-) background, suggesting that a large amount of IFN-gamma in SOCS1-deficient T cells suppressed Th17 differentiation. IL-6 plus TGF-beta enhanced retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor (ROR)-gammat expression and suppressed IFN-gamma production in wild-type T cells, whereas these effects were severely impaired in SOCS1-deficient T cells. These phenotypes can be partly explained by STAT3 suppression by enhanced SOCS3 induction through hyper-STAT1 activation in SOCS1-deficient T cells. In addition, SOCS1-deficient T cells were much less sensitive to TGF-beta. Suppression of Th1 differentiation by TGF-beta was impaired in SOCS1-deficient T cells. TGF-beta-mediated Smad transcriptional activity was severely inhibited in SOCS1-deficient cells in the presence of IFN-gamma. Such impairment of TGF-beta functions were not observed in SOCS3-overexpressed cells, indicating that suppression of Smads was independent of SOCS3. Therefore, SOCS1 is necessary for Th17 differentiation by suppressing antagonistic effect of IFN-gamma on both STAT3 and Smads. Induction of SOCS3 can partly explain IFN-gamma-mediated STAT3 suppression, while other mechanism(s) will be involved in IFN-gamma-mediated Smad suppression.

De-repression appears to be triggered such that more robust XRN2 perturbation, by elimination of both PAXT-1 and BPNT1, is less detrimental to worm viability than absence of PAXT-1 alone.

Several lines of evidence are presented showing that the regulation of synthesis of gene 32 protein is abnormal in dar 1-infected cells. In these cells, gene 32 protein, an early protein, is also expressed late in the infectious cycle. Our data also indicate that the packaging og DNA into T4 phage heads is delayed in dar mutant-infected cells, and this in turn results in a 6- to 8-min delay in intracellular progeny formation, although the synthesis of late proteins appears to be normal, as shown by gel electrophoresis. We have also studied the phenotypes of the double mutant dar-amC5 (gene 59). The increased sensitivity to hydroxyurea caused by a mutation in the dar gene can be alleviated by a  second mutation in gene 59, but an increased sensitivity to UV irradiation caused by a mutation in gene 59 cannot be alleviated by a second mutation in the dar gene. Therefore, the double mutant still exhibits abnormalities in the repair of UV lesions."}], "dataset": "bioASQ"}, {"question": "Is Nanog repressed in pluripotent stem cells?", "answers": ["No. The homeobox gene Nanog is a key intrinsic determinant of self renewal in embryonic stem (ES) cells, and its repression leads ES cells to selectively differentiate into primitive endoderm.", "The homeobox gene Nanog is a key intrinsic determinant of self renewal in embryonic stem (ES) cells, and its repression leads ES cells to selectively differentiate into primitive endoderm.", "Aggregation of embryonic stem cells induces Nanog repression and primitive endoderm differentiation The homeobox gene Nanog is a key intrinsic determinant of self renewal in embryonic stem (ES) cells, and its repression leads ES cells to selectively differentiate into primitive endoderm."], "positive_ctxs": [{"passage_id": "16908534", "title": "The Grb2/Mek pathway represses Nanog in murine embryonic stem cells.", "text": "The homeobox gene Nanog is a key intrinsic determinant of self renewal in embryonic stem (ES) cells, and its repression leads ES cells to selectively differentiate into primitive endoderm. Although Nanog repression occurs at the outermost layer of ES cell aggregates independent of the leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)/STAT3 pathway, it is largely undetermined what external cues and intracellular signals cause the event. Of interest, addition of the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, sodium vanadate, selectively repressed Nanog transcription without any detectable changes in upstream transcriptional regulators Oct3/4 and Sox2. Furthermore, sodium vanadate induced primitive endoderm differentiation, even in the inner cells of ES cell aggregates. Expression of Gata6 and Zfp42, two putative downstream Nanog effectors, was also increased and decreased by the addition of sodium vanadate, respectively, but these changes were eliminated by exogenous Nanog expression. The effects of sodium vanadate were abrogated by Grb2 deficiency or by the addition of the Mek inhibitor, PD98059. Indeed, PD98059 prevented Nanog repression induced by ES cell aggregation as well.

Furthermore, in many studies the selective constraint at such sites in primates was claimed to be more stringent than that in rodents. Given the larger effective population sizes in rodents than in primates, the theoretical expectation is that selection in rodents would be more effective than that in primates. To resolve this contradiction between expectations and observations, we used processed pseudogenes as a model for strict neutral evolution, and estimated selective constraint on synonymous sites using the rate of substitution at pseudosynonymous and pseudononsynonymous sites in pseudogenes as the neutral expectation. After controlling for the effects of GC content, our results were similar to those from previous studies, i.e., synonymous sites in primates exhibited evidence for higher selective constraint that those in rodents. Specifically, our results indicated that in primates up to 24% of synonymous sites could be under purifying selection, while in rodents synonymous sites evolved neutrally. To further control for shifts in GC content, we estimated selective constraint at fourfold degenerate sites using a maximum parsimony approach. This allowed us to estimate selective constraint using mutational patterns that cause a shift in GC content (GT \u2194 TG, CT \u2194 TC, GA \u2194 AG, and CA \u2194 AC) and ones that do not (AT \u2194 TA and CG \u2194 GC). Using this approach, we found that synonymous sites evolve neutrally in both primates and rodents. Apparent deviations from neutrality were caused by a higher rate of C \u2192 A and C \u2192 T mutations in pseudogenes. Such differences are most likely caused by the shift in GC content experienced by pseudogenes.

Recent studies have shown that extracellular vesicles (EVs) from gram-negative periodontal pathogens, so-called outer membrane vesicles (OMVs), harbor various effector molecules responsible for inducing host inflammatory responses. However, there are no reports of EVs from F. alocis. In this study, we purified and characterized the protein profiles of EVs from F. alocis and investigated their immunostimulatory activity on human monocytic THP-1 and human oral keratinocyte HOK-16B cell lines. Highly pure EVs were obtained from F. alocis using density gradient ultracentrifugation. Nanoparticle tracking analysis and transmission electron microscopy showed that F. alocis EVs were between 50 and 270\u00a0nm in diameter. Proteome analysis identified 28 proteins, including lipoproteins, autolysins, F. alocis complement inhibitor (FACIN), transporter-related proteins, metabolism-related proteins, and ribosomal proteins. Human cytokine array analysis showed that F. alocis EVs remarkably induced the expression of CCL1, CCL2, MIP-1, CCL5, CXCL1, CXCL10, ICAM-1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-1ra, IL-6, IL-8, MIF, SerpinE, and TNF-\u03b1 in THP-1 cells and CXCL1, G-CSF, GM-CSF, IL-6, and IL-8 in HOK-16B cells.

The genetic polymorphism  is revealed by quantitative differences in idiotype expression between different inbred strains. In recombinant inbred strains linkage to the Ig-1d allotype allele of strain AKR is demonstrated. In a putative recombinant strain it appears that ACHd maps at a locus different from that of A5A+, another VH gene controlling idiotypes of anti-A-CHO antibodies.

The pathway is indispensable for the development of secretory cells by facilitating protein folding and enhancing secretory capacity. In the immune system, it is known to function in dendritic cells, plasma cells, and eosinophil development and differentiation, while its role in T helper cell is unexplored. Here, we investigated the role of the IRE1a-XBP1 pathway in regulating activation and differentiation of type-2 T helper cell (Th2), a major T helper cell type involved in allergy, asthma, helminth infection, pregnancy, and tumor immunosuppression. We perturbed the IRE1a-XBP1 pathway and interrogated its role in Th2 cell differentiation. We performed genome-wide transcriptomic analysis of differential gene expression to reveal IRE1a-XBP1 pathway-regulated genes and predict their biological role. To identify direct target genes of XBP1 and define XBP1's regulatory network, we performed XBP1 ChIPmentation (ChIP-seq). We validated our predictions by flow cytometry, ELISA, and qPCR. We also used a fluorescent ubiquitin cell cycle indicator mouse to demonstrate the role of XBP1 in the cell cycle. We show that Th2 lymphocytes induce the IRE1a-XBP1 pathway during in vitro and in vivo activation. Genome-wide transcriptomic analysis of differential gene expression by perturbing the IRE1a-XBP1 pathway reveals XBP1-controlled genes and biological pathways. Performing XBP1 ChIPmentation (ChIP-seq) and integrating with transcriptomic data, we identify XBP1-controlled direct target genes and its transcriptional regulatory network. We observed that the IRE1a-XBP1 pathway controls cytokine secretion and the expression of two Th2 signature cytokines, IL13 and IL5. We also discovered that the IRE1a-XBP1 pathway facilitates activation-dependent Th2 cell proliferation by facilitating cell cycle progression through S and G2/M phase. We confirm and detail the critical role of the IRE1a-XBP1 pathway during Th2 lymphocyte activation in regulating cytokine expression, secretion, and cell proliferation. Our high-quality genome-wide XBP1 ChIP and gene expression data provide a rich resource for investigating XBP1-regulated genes.
