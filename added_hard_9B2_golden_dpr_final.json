To evaluate the long-term efficacy of cabergoline monotherapy in patients with CD. Retrospective analysis of non-randomized clinical therapy with cabergoline in 30 patients with CD treated in academic centers of Buenos Aires and Montreal. Cabergoline was initiated at 0.5-1.0 mg/week and adjusted up to a maximal dose of 6 mg/week based on urinary free cortisol (UFC) levels. Complete response to cabergoline was defined as a sustained normalization of UFC with at least two normal values measured at 1-3 months interval; partial response was defined as a decrease of UFC to <125% of the upper limit of normal, and treatment failure as UFC \u2265 125% of it. Within 3-6 months, complete response was achieved in 11 patients (36.6%) and partial response in 4 patients (13.3%). After long-term therapy, nine patients (30%) remain with a complete response after a mean of 37 months (range from 12 to 60 months) with a mean dose of 2.1 mg/week of cabergoline.

In contrast to the ultrastructure of pituitary adenomas associated with Cushing's syndrome, no or only very few microfilaments were detected in the cytoplasm of the tumor cells, suggesting that adrenocortical steroids are required for the formation of microfilaments. The presence or absence of microfilaments in the tumor cells may be regarded as a distinguishing ultrastructural feature between Cushing's syndrome and Nelson's syndrome.

In this study, using in vivo expression technology (IVET), we attempted to identify mucin-inducible promoters that are likely to be involved in the establishment of P. aeruginosa infection. The IVET analysis revealed that the genes encoding glycosidases, sulfatases, and peptidases that are thought to be required for the utilization of mucin as a nutrient are present in 13 genes downstream of the identified promoters. Our results indicated that, among them, sdsA1 encoding a secreted sulfatase plays a central role in the degradation of mucin. It was then demonstrated that disruption of sdsA1 leads to a decreased release of sulfate from mucin and sulfated sugars.

ECMO is associated with an inflammatory response promoting a hypercoagulable state, requiring anticoagulation to avoid thromboembolism originating in the nonendothelial surfaced circuit. However, excessive anticoagulation may result in bleeding complications including intracerebral hemorrhage. Monitoring anticoagulation for ECMO has its origins in cardiopulmonary bypass for cardiac surgery; however, there is no ideal level of anticoagulation, no standardized method to monitor anticoagulation, nor are all centers standardized on what is used for anticoagulation. Multiple blood products are used in an effort to decrease bleeding in the setting of anticoagulation, often in the setting of recent surgery, and this leads to significant increases in cost for patients on ECMO and transfusion-related complications. In this review article, we discuss the evolution of the various modalities of ECMO, indications, contraindications, and complications. Furthermore, we review the different strategies for anticoagulation and treatment of coagulopathy while on ECMO. Finally, we discuss the cost of ECMO and associated blood product transfusion."}], "negative_ctxs": [], "hard_negative_ctxs": [{"passage_id": "45704", "title": "Scientific communications.", "text": "Scientific communications have two main forms, oral presentation at scientific meetings, accompanied by audio-visual aids, and manuscripts prepared for publication in scientific journals.

However, the clinicopathological and biological significance of MUC13 in human intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA) remain unclear. The aim of this study was to define the role of MUC13 in the progression of iCCA. Expression levels of MUC13 in human iCCA samples were evaluated by immunohistochemistry, western blot, and real-time PCR. In\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo experiments were used to assess the effect of MUC13 on iCCA cell growth and metastasis. Crosstalk between MUC13 and EGFR/PI3K/AKT signaling was analyzed by molecular methods. The upstream regulatory effects of MUC13 were evaluated by Luciferase and DNA methylation assays. MUC13 was overexpressed in human iCCA specimens and iCCA cells. MUC13 overexpression positively correlated with clinicopathological characteristics of iCCA, such as vascular invasion and lymph node metastasis, and was independently associated with poor survival. Results from loss-of-function and gain-of-function experiments suggested that knockdown of MUC13 attenuated, while overexpression of MUC13 enhanced, the proliferation, motility, and invasiveness of iCCA cells in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo. Mechanistically, we found that the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-AKT signal pathway and its downstream effectors, such as tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1 and matrix metallopeptidase 9, were required for MUC13-mediated tumor metastasis of iCCA. MUC13 interacted with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and subsequently activated the EGFR/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway by promoting EGFR dimerization and preventing EGFR internalization. We also found that MUC13 was directly regulated by miR-212-3p, whose downregulation was related to aberrant CpG hypermethylation in the promoter area. These findings suggest that aberrant hypermethylation-induced downregulation of miR-212-3p results in overexpression of MUC13 in iCCA, leading to metastasis via activation of the EGFR/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Mucin 13 overexpression has been implicated in\u00a0the development of malignancies, although its role in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma has not been studied.

Viscosity enhancement was proportional to albumin concentration (2-40mg/ml), was most pronounced under conditions of low shear rate (less than 45S-1), and was considerably greater than the additive or multiplicative viscosity values calculated from albumin or mucin solutions measured separately. The viscous mucin-albumin complex was destroyed by high shear rates (greater than 90S-1), but slowly re-formed under zero shear conditions. Elevation of pH (7 to 9), ionic strength (0.1 to 1.0), and addition of disodium EDTA (5mM) did not cause marked or specific alterations in the viscosity of the mixture, suggesting that electrostatic interactions probably do not stabilize mucin-albumin complexes. Urea (7M) and heating (35 to 55 degrees C) caused a major increase in the viscosity of mucin and mucin-albumin mixtures, suggesting that rupture of hydrogen bonds, unfolding and partial denaturation of mucin promotes greater intertangling (possibly hydrophobic interactions) between mucin and albumin molecules.

The 293T human cells are widely used in biology studies as they are highly transfectable. While parental 293 cells express high levels of STING, 293T cells lack STING and are unable to induce interferon antiviral responses to cytosolic DNA. Additionally, 293T cells express the SV40 polyomavirus large T antigen (LT) which enhances the replication of transfected DNA plasmids carrying the SV40 origin of replication. Since SV40 LT also encodes the LxCxE motif, the lack of STING expression in 293T cells is commonly assumed to be due to SV40 large T antigen. We find that SV40 LT does not alter exogenously expressed and endogenous levels of STING protein. We show that STING transcription is suppressed in 293T cells but is not driven by SV40. This study also revealed that SV40 LT does indeed inhibit cGAS-STING interferon induction, but through a mechanism distinct from other DNA virus oncogenes.

In all those cases who had similar stenosis in both branches of the left coronary artery the stress szintigram appeared to be unchanged or normal. Therefore an unchanged stress szintigram allows no conclusion on the condition of the coronary arteries. A normal stress szintigram can be found as well in patients with normal coronary arteries as in patients with severe coronary heart disease. The examination of 201 thallium szintigrams under stress conditions therefore needs some critical evaluation."}], "dataset": "bioASQ"}]
