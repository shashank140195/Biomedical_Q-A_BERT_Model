After day 8.5 of gestation, Mash-2 expression becomes further restricted to focal sites within the spongiotrophoblast and labyrinth. Downregulation is probably important for normal development since overexpression of Mash-2 reduces giant cell formation. We have investigated the role that the Notch signaling pathway may play in trophoblast development. Mash-2 is a homologue of Drosophila achaete/scute complex genes. In Drosophila, activation of the Notch receptor induces transcriptional repressors encoded by the hairy/Enhancer of split (HES) genes, which interact with the Groucho protein to shut off achaete-scute transcription. In the developing mouse placenta, we found that all elements of the Notch pathway were expressed.

Two members of the mammalian Groucho family were expressed in trophoblasts; TLE3 was expressed broadly in the giant cell, spongiotrophoblast, and labyrinthine regions, whereas TLE2 was limited to giant cells and focal regions of the spongiotrophoblast.

Since previous studies have shown that drugs impairing cognitive function (including scopolamine, NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor antagonists, and nociceptin receptor agonists) disrupt or decrease power of elicited theta oscillation in the hippocampus, we tested the effects of acute and sub-chronic administration of semagacestat in this assay.

This phase 3 randomised trial had two parts. Part one was a double-blind study in which patients with symptomatic, advanced TGCT for whom surgery was not recommended were randomly assigned via an integrated web response system (1:1) to the pexidartinib or placebo group. Individuals in the pexidartinib group received a loading dose of 1000 mg pexidartinib per day orally (400 mg morning; 600 mg evening) for the first 2 weeks, followed by 800 mg per day (400 mg twice a day) for 22 weeks. Part two was an open-label study of pexidartinib for all patients. The primary endpoint, assessed in all intention-to-treat patients, was overall response at week 25, and was centrally reviewed by RECIST, version 1.1. Safety was analysed in all patients who received at least one dose of the study drug. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02371369.

Macroautophagy (hereafter autophagy) is an intracellular degradative pathway where superfluous or unwanted cellular cargoes (such as peroxisomes, mitochondria, ribosomes, intracellular bacteria and misfolded protein aggregates) are wrapped in double membrane vesicles called autophagosomes that eventually fuses with lysosomes for their degradation. The selective branch of autophagy that deals with identification, capture and degradation of protein aggregates is called aggrephagy. Here, we cover the workings of aggrephagy detailing its selectivity towards aggregates. The diverse cellular adaptors that bridge the aggregates with the core autophagy machinery in terms of autophagosome formation are discussed. In ND, essential protein quality control mechanisms fail as the constituent components also find themselves trapped in the aggregates. Thus, although cellular aggrephagy has the potential to be upregulated, its dysfunction further aggravates the pathogenesis. This phenomenonwhen combined with the fact that neurons can neither dilute out the aggregates by cell division nor the dead neurons can be replaced due to low neurogenesis, makes a compelling case for aggrephagy pathway as a potential therapeutic option."}], "negative_ctxs": [], "hard_negative_ctxs": [{"passage_id": "34274", "title": "[Comparison of k therapies after determination of success and failure].", "text": "To compare k therapeutic methods, N patients are suggested to be assigned to k therapies at random.

Moreover, MM-GBSA calculations suggested that hydrophobic interactions between lapatinib and HER2 contribute most to the binding affinity, and that the L755P mutation could result in a less energetically favorable HER2/lapatinib complex.

Classic genetic studies found that an extra X chromosome frequently causes psychiatric symptoms in patients with either Klinefelter syndrome (XXY) or Triple X syndrome (XXX). Over-dosage of some X-linked escapee genes was suggested to cause psychiatric disorders. However, relevance of these rare genetic diseases to the pathogenesis of psychiatric disorders in the general population of psychiatric patients is unknown. XIST and several X-linked genes were studied in 36 lymphoblastoid cell lines from healthy females and 60 lymphoblastoid cell lines from female patients with either bipolar disorder or recurrent major depression. XIST and KDM5C expression was also quantified in 48 RNA samples from postmortem human brains of healthy female controls and female psychiatric patients. We found that the XIST gene, a master in control of X chromosome inactivation (XCI), is significantly over-expressed (p\u00a0=\u00a01\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010(-\u00a07), corrected after multiple comparisons) in the lymphoblastoid cells of female patients with either bipolar disorder or major depression. The X-linked escapee gene KDM5C also displays significant up-regulation (p\u00a0=\u00a05.3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010(-\u00a07), corrected after multiple comparisons) in the patients' cells. Expression of XIST and KDM5C is highly correlated (Pearson's coefficient, r\u00a0=\u00a00.78, p\u00a0=\u00a01.3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010(-\u00a013)). Studies on human postmortem brains supported over-expression of the XIST gene in female psychiatric patients. We propose that over-expression of XIST may cause or result from subtle alteration of XCI, which up-regulates the expression of some X-linked escapee genes including KDM5C. Over-expression of X-linked genes could be a common mechanism for the development of psychiatric disorders between patients with those rare genetic diseases and the general population of female psychiatric patients with XIST over-expression. Our studies suggest that XIST and KDM5C expression could be used as a biological marker for diagnosis of psychiatric disorders in a significantly large subset of female patients. Due to lack of biological markers, diagnosis and treatment of psychiatric disorders are subjective. There is utmost urgency to identify biomarkers for clinics, research, and drug development. We found that XIST and KDM5C gene expression may be used as a biological marker for diagnosis of major affective disorders in a significantly large subset of female patients from the general population. Our studies show that over-expression of XIST and some X-linked escapee genes may be a common mechanism for development of psychiatric disorders between the patients with rare genetic diseases (XXY or XXX) and the general population of female psychiatric patients."}], "negative_ctxs": [], "hard_negative_ctxs": [{"passage_id": "152176", "title": "Cytogenetic abnormalities in orthopedic patients.", "text": "Patients with orthopedic problems may also have chromosomal abnormalities. Individuals who present with subtle clinical findings suggestive of a known syndrome resulting from a chromosomal abnormality, such as Klinefelter syndrome, Turner syndrome, or any of the known trisomiers, should be investigated further in order to confirm the diagnosis. In addition, those patients who have multiple congenital abnormalities in several systems should also have chromosome analysis. This should be done not only to gain new information in regard to chromosome abnormalities, but also to establish a diagnosis for the individual and thus provide proper genetic counseling for the family. If the clinical picture strongly suggests a chromosomal abnormality, and routine karyotyping does not demonstrate one, it is imperative that one or more banding techniques be utilized before a chromosomal abnormality can be ruled out."}], "dataset": "bioASQ"}, {"question": "What distinguishes RIDLs from other transpozable elements?", "answers": ["Repeat Insertion Domains of LncRNAs (RIDLs) are exonic TEs that are essential for lncRNA function.", "Ancient exapted transposable elements promote nuclear enrichment of human long noncoding RNAs .

It has been proposed that lncRNA are organized into combinations of discrete functional domains, but the nature of these and their identification remain elusive. One class of sequence elements that is enriched in lncRNA is represented by transposable elements (TEs), repetitive mobile genetic sequences that have contributed widely to genome evolution through a process termed exaptation. Here, we link these two concepts by proposing that exonic TEs act as RNA domains that are essential for lncRNA function. We term such elements Repeat Insertion Domains of LncRNAs (RIDLs). A growing number of RIDLs have been experimentally defined, where TE-derived fragments of lncRNA act as RNA-, DNA-, and protein-binding domains. We propose that these reflect a more general phenomenon of exaptation during lncRNA evolution, where inserted TE sequences are repurposed as recognition sites for both protein and nucleic acids. We discuss a series of genomic screens that may be used in the future to systematically discover RIDLs. The RIDL hypothesis has the potential to explain how functional evolution can keep pace with the rapid gene evolution observed in lncRNA. More practically, TE maps may in the future be used to predict lncRNA function."}], "negative_ctxs": [], "hard_negative_ctxs": [{"passage_id": "99472", "title": "Stress and menstrual distress.", "text": "The relationship between stress and menstrual distress is considered in response to three questions: (1) How stressful are menstruation and its associated events?
